# Roobet Rains

Roobet Rains is a web application that alerts you when a "rain" event is active on the Roobet casino. During a rain event, if youâ€™re subscribed, you receive a share of the prize directly in your account. With the page open in the background, you will be notified with an alert when a rain event occurs. The app also provides user authentication and other functionalities.

## Features

- **User management:** Update coins, track claimed rains, and manage user data.
- **Rain event management:** Save new rain events and update existing ones.
- **Templating engine:** Server-side rendered views using Handlebars.

## Technologies
